### TLDR;
- sold out
- full packed agenda with container/kubernetes topics
- co-hosting the first MCP-Confernce!

It is February and London is showing some rain for us. As a german located in Hamburg, it´s no big deal for me.  Luckeliy for all others that are more sunnshine minded the containerdays in London where heating up the rain with the hottest in Container-technology that is possible.
### Good Morning - 9am let´s start!
As usual, it started with the register part and picking up your badge. The first surprise - no conference-shirt, but a cool beanie with the logo. I need to admin, after getting comfy with the orange I really like it and wear it as often as I can. A huge thank you to the organizers.
### The keynote - that I missed :(
The keynote was held by - [Amanda Brock](https://www.containerdays.io/containerdays-london-2026/agenda/#) with the topic "Open Source powering the Digital Economy!". I need to admit, I was into conversations in the exhibition-area that I missed it - really sorry.
### Yet another conference?
Going through all topics would be far to long and detailed. I like to point out some special Speakers and Sessions that standout and left a lasting impression:
### 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: 𝗦𝘆𝗺𝗽𝗵𝗼𝗻𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 - [Sarah Peters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahnpeters/)  
I’m at a loss for words—music and software development have more in common than you’d think! If you get the chance to see Sarah speak, take it. It’s mind-blowing.    
### 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗦𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 – 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗪𝗲 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗜𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗪𝗮𝘆? - [Pieter Vincken](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieter-vincken/)  
This talk reminded me to channel my inner coding monk more often. IaC is software development. Thank you, Pieter, for the wake-up call! 
### 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿 – 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗗𝗼 𝗜𝘁 𝗥𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 - [Michael Schmitt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-schmitt-ist-cool/) 
Ever considered writing an operator? Get Michael’s advice before you start. Thanks, for sharing valuable insights! 
### 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝘀: 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲, 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗢𝗖𝗜 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗡𝗶𝘅 - [Arik Grahl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arikgrahl/)  
Let’s challenge the status quo. Building OCI containers differently and getting familiar with Nix - thank you, Arik, for this fresh perspective!
### 𝗭𝗲𝗿𝗼 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀: 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗘𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗠𝗲𝘀𝗵 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗜𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼 – [Hannah Olukoye](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannaholukoye/) & 𝘔𝘰𝘧𝘦𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘢 𝘉𝘢𝘣𝘢𝘭𝘰𝘭𝘢  
If you’ve ever wondered about the "castle-and-moat" model, why you’d use a service mesh like Istio, or how Ztunnel works with SPIFFE identities—this was the talk for you. A fantastic technical deep dive into Zero Trust. Thank you both!
### 𝗙𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝗺 - [Nigel Douglas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-douglas-devrel/) 
If you only think about CVEs and CVSS scores, you’re only halfway there. Nigel took us on a technical deep dive into exploitability, mixing EPSS, CISA KEV, and Exploit-DB. Always a pleasure to see you speak, Nigel!  
### 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗪𝗔𝗦𝗠 𝗼𝗻 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 - [Frederik Pietzko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederik-pietzko/) 
I’ll admit—I was skeptical. My only experience with WebAssembly was in browser canvases. But this session was well worth the time! WASM in Kubernetes/containerd could be a game-changer. Seeing 200 pods spin up in a minute on a standard laptop? Impressive. Let’s see where this goes—thank you, Frederik!  
  
### And of course a special shoutout to my colleague [Bjarne Valentin Rentz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bjarne-valentin-rentz/), who delivered the talk "𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝘆𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗔𝗰𝘁 (𝗖𝗥𝗔), 𝗦𝗕𝗢𝗠𝘀, 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗬𝗢𝗨!" with me. Always a blast performing with you on stage!
## Summary
I was unsure at the beginning - is it just another ContainerDays franchise (I was used to Container-Days Hamburg, Germany) or is really something unique and different. After these two days I can  clearly say - Containerdays London is a unique event and should be something that you 
Thanks for having me there - if you want I would come back next year for sure :)
